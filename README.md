- The system should track every interaction with a QR code, such as: The time and location of the scan. The device or browser used.
- Users should be able to view detailed performance metrics of their QR codes, including:Total scans. Unique users. Time-based trends (e.g., scans per day/week). Geographic distribution of scans. Device or platform analysis.
- Ensure that QR codes are only accessible or editable by their respective owners. This means implementing proper user authentication and authorization.
